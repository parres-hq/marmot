## Nostr Group Data Extension

`draft` `mandatory`

The nostr group data extension is a custom MLS extension used to associate Nostr and group specific data with an MLS group in a cryptographically secure and proveable way. This extension MUST be included as a required capability when creating a new group.

### Extension Fields

The extension stores the following data about the group:

- `nostr_group_id`: A 32-byte ID for the group. This is a different value from the group ID used by MLS and CAN be changed over time. This value is the group ID value used in the `h` tags when sending group message events.
- `name`: The name of the group.
- `description`: A short description of the group.
- `admin_pubkeys`: An array of the hex-encoded nostr public keys of the group admins. The MLS protocol itself does not have a concept of group admins. Clients MUST check the list of `admin_pubkeys` before making any change to the group data (anything in this extension), before changing group membership (add/remove members), or updating any other aspect of the group itself (e.g. ciphersuite, etc.). Note, all members of the group can send `Proposal` and `Commits` messages for changes to their own credentials (e.g. updating their signing key).
- `relays`: An array of the Nostr relay URLs that the group uses to publish and receive messages.

All of these values can be updated over time using MLS `Proposal` and `Commit` events.
