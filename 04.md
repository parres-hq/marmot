## Encrypted Media

`draft` `optional`

This document defines how to securely share media files (images, videos, audio, documents) within Marmot groups while maintaining end-to-end encryption and privacy guarantees.

This is different to the way in which group avatar images are encrypted and shared among group members via the `marmot_group_data` extension detailed in [MIP-01](01.md).
