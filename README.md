# 🦫 Marmot Protocol

![Marmot Protocol](https://blossom.primal.net/d9f2c5746e6b20e12517a5d775cb5f35c82b531dbe028a3bc8dca6d3bd90b344.png)

**Secure, decentralized group messaging that protects both content and metadata**

Marmot combines the [MLS Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html) with [Nostr's](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) decentralized network to deliver truly private group messaging without relying on centralized servers or legacy identity systems.

## Why Marmot?

- 🔒 **End-to-End Encrypted**: Messages are encrypted on your device and can only be read by intended recipients
- 🌐 **Decentralized**: No central servers to shut down or compromise
- 🛡️ **Metadata Protection**: Hides who you're talking to, not just what you're saying
- ⚡ **Scalable**: Efficient group messaging for small teams to large communities
- 🔗 **Interoperable**: Works across different clients and implementations
- 🆔 **Identity Freedom**: No phone numbers or email addresses required

Marmot addresses critical limitations in existing messaging systems:

- **Signal**: Excellent E2EE but centralized infrastructure vulnerable to shutdown
- **NIP-04/NIP-17**: Basic encryption but lacks forward secrecy and group messaging
- **Traditional Platforms**: Vulnerable to mass surveillance and censorship

By combining MLS's proven cryptography with Nostr's decentralized architecture, Marmot provides the security of Signal with the censorship resistance of decentralized protocols.

## Security Overview

Marmot maintains strong security guarantees through MLS:

- **Forward Secrecy**: Past messages remain secure even if current keys are compromised
- **Post-Compromise Security**: Key rotation limits impact of future compromises
- **Identity Separation**: MLS signing keys are distinct from Nostr identity keys
- **Regular Key Rotation**: Automatic key updates enhance security over time

## Protocol Specifications

Before implementing Marmot, you should have:

- **Nostr Knowledge**: Understanding of keys, kinds, tags, and relays ([Learn Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr))
- **MLS Basics**: Familiarity with the MLS protocol concepts ([MLS Overview](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9750.html), [ELI5 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FESp2LHd42U))

### Experimental

**⚠️ Important: Marmot is currently experimental software.**

While the protocol is based on proven cryptographic foundations (MLS and Nostr), the Marmot specification itself is still under active development. Key considerations:

- **Breaking Changes**: The protocol may undergo breaking changes as we refine the specification
- **Security Review**: The protocol has not yet undergone formal security auditing
- **Implementation Maturity**: Reference implementations are functional but may contain bugs
- **Interoperability**: Cross-client compatibility is a goal but not yet fully tested

**Use in Production**: We recommend against using Marmot for production applications until the protocol reaches stable status. Current implementations are suitable for:
- Research and development
- Proof-of-concept applications
- Contributing to protocol development
- Educational purposes

We welcome feedback, security analysis, and contributions to help mature the protocol toward production readiness.
